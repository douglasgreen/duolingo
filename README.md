My personal repository of Duolingo vocabulary and notes

## Abbreviations
* m. = masculine
* f. = feminine
* nt. = neuter
* sg. = singular
* pl. = plural

## Gender
Mark gender on these languages that use l' as ambiguous:
* French
* Italian

In French, the feminine form usually adds +e to the masculine form plus other
minor changes such as:
* Adding accent marks (cher/ch√®re)
* Doubling final n (bon/bonne)
* Adding qu to c (grec/grecque)
* Adding u to g (long/longue)
* Change f to v (juif/juive)
* Change x to s (paresseux/paresseuse) or c (doux/douce)

If the masculine form already ends in e, you can assume that the feminine form
is the same and leave it unmarked if so.

In Latin, there is no word for the so we have to infer gender as follows:
* us/i = masculine
* a/ae = feminine
* um/a = neuter

Mark any other ending with its gender.

## Word forms
Use / to separate different genders or closely related forms.

Don't put spaces around the /.

Repeat the word if only the article varies, for example el estudiante/la
estudiante.

Use ; to separate unrelated translations.
